# Favorite_Book_app
An app that stores you favorite books. 
Think of it as a wish list of books. You're walking by a book store and they're out of a copy you particularly want. This app interacts with Google's online book data base and stores the book for future reference. I used dart and flutter to make this. It has a drop down menu that get updated every time a character is typed.
